      <p class="lead">We think democracy thrives when the voices of Internet users are heard in Washington. The easier it is for you to reach your member of Congress, the better. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
      <p>In fact, failure to effectively reach members of Congress has disastrous consequences. Studies shows that politicians <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~broockma/broockman_skovron_asymmetric_misperceptions.pdf"> fundamentally misconceive</a> their constituents&rsquo; views, making it harder for them to represent us in the lawmaking process.</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s why we built democracy.io: a new tool to put you in touch with your members of Congress&mdash;with as few clicks as possible.</p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>We make it possible for you to email your two senators and representative through a single website. You submit one message&mdash;not three different messages on three different forms on three different websites.</p>
      <p>Some key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to use.</strong> A simple interface that lets you contact all your senators and representatives on one website.</li>
        <li><strong>Say whatever you want.</strong> Many activism platforms want you to send a pre-written message about a specific topic. We let you tell Congress exactly what&rsquo;s on your mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed delivery.</strong> If you see the green check sign, you can rest assured that your message will be delivered.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy first.</strong> We follow the best practices outlined in EFF&rsquo;s annual <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015"> Who Has Your Back</a> report for protecting the privacy of users.</li>
        <li><strong>Free software.</strong> All our code is licensed under the GPL, which means people can create new versions with different features and continue to improve on our original idea.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why we&rsquo;re doing this.</h2>
      <p>First, we want contacting your elected officials to be easy. Then more people will do it. And that&rsquo;s good for democracy.</p>
      <p>We also want to show off the functionality of the tools EFF has been creating over the last several years. Working from a codebase original created by the Participatory Politics Foundation and later adopted by and improved upon by the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and several collaborating organizations. Together, we&rsquo;ve been working on a large-scale project to improve how Internet users contact elected officials and other decision makers.</p>
      <p>Democracy.io lets you test out one of these tools&mdash;emailing members of Congress&mdash;but we&rsquo;re also creating simple ways to send Tweets to members of Congress, call Congress, sign petitions, and submit official comments to government agencies. If you&rsquo;re an advocacy organization that likes how this works, check out our <a href="https://github.com/EFForg"> Github page</a> and contact <a href="mailto:rainey@eff.org?Subject=Democracy.io" target="_top">rainey@eff.org</a> to discuss whether these free software, user-focused tools are a good solution for your advocacy needs.</p>
      <h2>Who is behind this project</h2>
      <p>Democracy.io was built by three amazing programmers who want to make the world a better place&mdash;Sina Khanifar, <a href="http://l12s.com">Leah Jones</a>, and <a href="http://randylubin.com/">Randy Lubin</a>, as part of a project for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It&rsquo;s maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
      <p>The backend system that delivers these messages to Congress was written by EFF employee William Budington, drawing inspiration from work by the Participatory Politics Foundation. Delivery is made possible by the open source <a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress"> contact-congress</a> dataset that was started by the Sunlight Foundation and completed with help from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/dear-web-developers-thank-you-youre-awesome-and-wow-did-really-just-happen"> over 100 EFF volunteer web developers,</a> (and in particular <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/volunteer-technologists"> these five individuals</a>). The dataset is now maintained by EFF, the Sunlight Foundation, and Action Network.</p>
      <p>Jump in, change the world.</p>
      <p>Want to help with this and future technology projects? If you&rsquo;re a web developer who might want to occasionally volunteer, send an email to rainey@eff.org and also sign up with <a href="https://taskforce.is"> Taskforce</a>, EFF&rsquo;s partners on many ventures to make the Internet more awesome and free.</p>
